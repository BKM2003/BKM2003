Hello, I'm Kaan! I am a third-year Mathematics/Economics student at the University of California, Los Angeles. My professional interest areas are investment banking, macro policy, and business consulting. 

I've previously worked on various projects and internships related to product development, small-scale business consulting projects, and financial services. I am interested in focusing on the mathematical and analytical aspects of finance and consulting, promoting rational and sustainable solutions. 

I love music, philosophy, debate, and learning new languages. I took ABRSM Royal Academy Piano exams and received certificates. My multicultural background enabled me to learn and be aware of different cultures, societies, and languages, which helped me adapt easily to new environments.
